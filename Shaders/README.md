Shaders will be placed into separate folders based on their respective engine versions

Your shaders will be in the ENGINEVERSION\Engine\Shaders\Private folder

Back up your local file, then overwrite it with the one saved from GitHub

Relaunch the editor or recompile shaders within the editor by ctrl + shift + .
